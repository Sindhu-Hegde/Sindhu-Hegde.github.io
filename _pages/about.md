Hi! I am a second year PhD student in the [Visual Geometry Group (VGG)](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/) at the University of Oxford, supervised by [Prof. Andrew Zisserman](https://scholar.google.co.uk/citations?user=UZ5wscMAAAAJ&hl=en). My research is in Computer Vision, particularly in multimodal learning, video understanding and self-supervised learning.
<!-- with an immense interest and enthusiasm in the areas of Computer Vision & AI.  -->

Prior to joining Oxford, I worked as a Lead Data Scientist @ [Verisk Analytics](https://www.verisk.com). Before that, I pursued Masters' by Research (MS) at [Centre for Visual Information Technology (CVIT), IIIT Hyderabad](http://cvit.iiit.ac.in) supervised by [Prof. C V Jawahar](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~jawahar/index.html) (IIIT-H) and [Prof. Vinay Namboodiri](https://vinaypn.github.io) (University of Bath, UK). My Masters' research focused on exploiting the redundancies in vision and speech modalities for cross-modal generation. 

**Research interests:** Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Video Understanding, Multi-modal Learning: Vision + Speech/Language <br><br>
