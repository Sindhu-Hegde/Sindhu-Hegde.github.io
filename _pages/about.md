Hi! I am a Machine Learning Researcher @ Verisk Analytics, with an immense interest and enthusiasm in the areas of Computer Vision & AI. 

Prior to joining Verisk, I pursued Masters' by Research (MS) at [Centre for Visual Information Technology (CVIT), IIIT Hyderabad](http://cvit.iiit.ac.in) supervised by [Prof. C V Jawahar](https://faculty.iiit.ac.in/~jawahar/index.html) (IIIT-H) and [Prof. Vinay Namboodiri](https://vinaypn.github.io) (University of Bath, UK). My Masters' research focused on exploiting the redundancies in vision and speech modalities for cross-modal generation. 

**Research interests:** Computer Vision, Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Speech Processing, Multi-modal Learning: Vision + Speech/Language
